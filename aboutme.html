    <h6>Rockets aren't the only way to space, you know.</h6>
    <p> We wouldn't have gone up on the moon had we not looked up, in the first place. <br> Perhaps it is the same childlike curiosity that has kept us ahead of our contemporary species.<br> Stars, airplanes, or rockets, whatever feeds your imagination and curiosity is bound to make progress.

        <br>Take astronomy and couple it with poetry. Classic literature?
        <br>I do believe in the philosophy that everything happens around in circles, that you frequently come back where you started at; only this time, your perspectives have changed. Classic, but timeless, I feel, is the essence of writing about stars, and somewhat being able to relate it to our lives.
        
        <br>Where else would one carve the complexities and incomprehensibilities of the world? How else would one materialize their worldview without a particular expertise in art? Random scribbles, that today are flashy padded pixels on your phone, laptop or any other electronic device. Different appearances and technicalities, but the same, timeless, essence.
        
        <br><br><br>Hi, I am Swarna Dutta, an undergraduate aerospace engineer, trying to scribble my worldview in words.</p>
